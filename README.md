**OBJECTIVES**

Find out why customers are churning.
Develop a model that will accurately predict future rate of churning.
Find a probable solution to reduce churning.

**MODELLING**

Algorithms used:
Logistic Regression

- As our recall score for our model was .74 as good as it is a predictive model, more time is needed for further engineering to help improve this score.

- For SyriaTel to improve on customer retention they need to deploy the machine learning model to get realtime predicitions.
Realtime continuous monitoring ensure the model is always learning and improving with time. With use of feature importance on can leverage it to provide insight on how to target service improvements and personalize retention efforts.
